#### [DEEPre: sequence-based enzyme EC number prediction by deep learning](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00559-16)

This paper presents a computational approach, DEEPre, for predicting enzyme functions by determining their Enzyme Commission number. This approach is crucial for applications in metagenomics, industrial biotechnology, and diagnosing enzyme deficiency diseases due to the high cost of experimental function determination. DEEPre introduces an end-to-end feature selection and classification model, utilizing raw enzyme sequence encodings to extract relevant features automatically, thus bypassing the need for manual feature crafting. It showcases superior prediction performance over existing methods through extensive validation on large datasets and outperforms other servers in classifying enzyme classes on a low-homology dataset. Additionally, DEEPre's effectiveness is demonstrated in case studies that highlight its ability to discern functional differences between enzyme isoforms.
